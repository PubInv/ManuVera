# ManuVera
This is a project developed by a team during the Rice360 15th Annual Global Health Technologies Design Competition. They developed forearm and upper arm components for a prosthetic hand design.

# Project Summary:
ManuVera is an innovative prosthetic arm solution developed by undergraduate students from the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). Designed with accessibility and user comfort in mind, ManuVera offers a lightweight, low-cost, and easily replaceable alternative to conventional prosthetic arms. It is approximately 10 times more affordable than the lowest-cost options currently available on the market.

The device uses a nitinol-based actuator system, allowing it to function similarly to electric prosthetics but without the burden of heavy motors or complex electronics. Its simple and intuitive design requires no training, making it especially friendly for children and first-time users.

# Project Goals:
We believe ManuVera holds significant potential to improve the lives of amputees—particularly in underserved regions—and may inspire further innovation in the field. To encourage open collaboration and future breakthroughs, we are committed to publishing all aspects of the project and making our work fully accessible.
